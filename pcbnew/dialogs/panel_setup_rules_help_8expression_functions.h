"\n"
"    A.existsOnLayer('<layer_name>')\n"
"        True if `A` exists on the given layer.  The layer name can be\n"

"\n"
"1. A reference designator, possibly containing wildcards `*` and `?`\n"
"2. A footprint library identifier such as `LibName:FootprintName`. In this case,\n"
"   the library identifier must contain the `:` character to separate the library\n"
