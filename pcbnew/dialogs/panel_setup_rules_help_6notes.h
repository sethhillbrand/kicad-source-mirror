"`signal_length` vs `length`:\n"
"\n"
"When both `signal_length` and `length` constraints apply to a routed item that belongs to a signal (i.e. the net has a non-empty signal name), the `signal_length` constraint is evaluated on the aggregate of all nets in that signal and takes precedence for violation reporting and length/delay tuning targets. The per-net `length` constraint continues to apply to nets that are not part of any multi‑net signal group.\n"
"\n"
"Time-domain targets:\n"
"\n"
"Both `length` and `signal_length` support `(time_domain yes)` for propagation delay based constraints. For `signal_length` with time domain enabled, the specified delay window applies to the total signal delay; the router/tuner subtracts the already-routed delay contribution of the other nets in the signal to derive the remaining per‑net tuning requirement.\n"
